# MIRUS
CoDas project 1 for MIRUS-IMU gesture detection

This directory contains the second part of the MIRAS IMU analysis done from 08.08.2022 until 15.10.2022 by Eileen Kr√§nzle.

Data
The collected data can be found in the data directory.
In this directory the data of 11 control subjects (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K) can be found. From the left-handed subject G, data was collected from his right arm (GR) and his left arm (GL).
Further, the draft directory can be copied for collecting new data, since it contains the necessary structure and files for easy usage with the python scripts. There are also some additional directories (test, test_2, test_3) containing different test measurements of the sensors.
In each directory there are:


Two screenshots named orientation.pgn and reset heading.png documenting the drift of the sensors: One screenshot was taken right after the heading reset and the other one after all measurements were done and the sensors were removed from the subject. There are corresponding recordings in these two positions available aswell.


raw_data: the raw data of the recordings. For each recording one .mtb file is stored. This file is converted using the MT manager to .txt files, which results in one .txt file for each sensor with the following name convention: MT_awinda base station id-run number-000-sensor id.txt


overview.xlsx: gives an overview of all the tasks performed and matches the tasks to the files available in the raw_data directory.


task name: should be unique, repetitive tasks are distinguished with numbers. heading reset, calibration X, pointing X, BBT X, 9HPT X and orientation (with X as a number) are recognized in the scipt. All other task names are ignored.

run number: refering to the correct run number of the task

Time: time, when the measurement was done

Test result: for BBT number of blocks transfered, for 9HPT measured time in seconds

Start time: time point when actual task starts (is used for task cutting of FNT, BBT, 9HPT)

Middle time: only for 9HPT: time point when change from putting pegs in to removing pegs happens (is used for task cutting)

End time: time point when actual task ends (is used for task cutting of FNT, BBT, 9HPT)

Repetitions: number of repetitions (standard number 5 for FNT, 9 for 9HPT, number of blocks for BBT) (is used for repetition splitting, currently only used for FNT)



Study protocol: contains questionaire & other particularities for the measurements with the corresponding subject



Data Preprocessing
The data preprocessing is the same as in the first IMU analysis (MIRAS-IMU analysis) and consists of manual task cutting, gravity removal and a low pass filter. It is done in the imu_analysis.ipynb script.

Feature extraction
The feature extraction is currently only done for the FNT with the same features as in the first IMU analysis. It is also done in the imu_analysis.ipynb script.
For the two new tasks (BBT and 9HPT), no feature extraction was performed yet, because there is no patient data available yet.

Storage of extracted features
The results of the imu_analysis.ipynb script are stored in the Results directory. For each feature a .csv file is generated containing the feature for each subject, task, sensor, signal type and axis.

Comparison
The comparison is done in the comparison.ipynb script, which produces plots that are stored in the plots directory.

Documentation
The main documentation is done in the same report as the first IMU analysis and therefore in the MIRAS-IMU analysis directory. For the measurements some pictures, videos and graphics are stored in the pictures and videos directory documenting the experiments. The last PowerPoint presentation in the MIRAS-IMU analysis directory is also about the measurements.
